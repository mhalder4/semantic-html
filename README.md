# Website Refactor Challenge

## Description

This project's goal was to help a hypothetical company refactor their website to be better optimized when being searched on a search engine. This exercise served as a way to use semantic HTML tags of different types and to consolidate code so that it is not redundant or inefficient. The usage of semantic tags will allow the site to be found more easily through a search engine and the refactoring makes the code easier to read and interpret for any future users or developers.

## Installation

The pertinent files for the project, including this README can all be found in the Github repository located at: . The website can be found at the Github pages address that follows: 

## Usage

The website has a navigation bar in the upper right hand corner with three options that link to information further down in the page. A screenshot of the website is shown below.

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
